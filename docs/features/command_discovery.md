# Command Discovery

PICLE's discovery flow is model-driven. The same field metadata powers inline help, the `help` command, tab completion, and the built-in `man` commands.

## Example Model

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, StrictStr


class ConnectionPlugin(str, Enum):
    netmiko = "netmiko"
    napalm = "napalm"
    pyats = "pyats"
    scrapli = "scrapli"


class TargetFilters(BaseModel):
    hosts: Union[StrictStr, List[StrictStr]] = Field(
        None, description="Select hostnames to run this task for"
    )

    @staticmethod
    def source_hosts():
        return ["ceos1", "ceos2", "ceos3"]


class DeviceCli(TargetFilters):
    commands: Union[StrictStr, List[StrictStr]] = Field(
        ..., description="CLI commands to send to devices"
    )
    plugin: ConnectionPlugin = Field("netmiko", description="Connection plugin name")

    class PicleConfig:
        subshell = True


class DeviceTools(BaseModel):
    cli: DeviceCli = Field(None, description="Send CLI commands to devices")


class Root(BaseModel):
    devices: DeviceTools = Field(None, description="Device operations")
```

## Inline Help

Use `?` to show the next valid command field.

Use `??` to show the same list with extra details such as defaults and field types.

```text
picle#devices?
 ... available fields under `devices` ...

picle#devices cli commands?
 <'commands' value>    CLI commands to send to devices

picle#devices cli??
 ... the same fields, plus defaults and field types ...
```

If a field is backed by an enum, help prints the allowed values.

If a model defines `source_<field>()`, help uses that method to show dynamic choices.

```text
picle#help devices cli plugin
 <'plugin' value>    netmiko, napalm, pyats, scrapli

picle#help devices cli hosts
 <'hosts' value>    ceos1, ceos2, ceos3
```

If the current model supports subshell entry, help also shows `<ENTER>`.

```text
picle#help devices cli
 ...
 <ENTER>    Enter command subshell
```

## `help`

`help` uses the same parser as normal command entry, so it understands nested models, aliases, enum values, and partial matches.

```text
picle#help
 ... top-level commands plus built-in commands like exit, top, pwd, end, cls ...

picle#help devices
 ... fields under `devices` ...

picle#help dev
 ... partial-match help for `devices` ...
```

## Tab Completion

Tab completion is available through the standard `cmd.Cmd` hooks.

- The first token completes top-level fields and built-in commands such as `exit`, `top`, and `help`.
- Nested completion works after you have already entered part of a command path.
- Enum fields complete from enum values.
- `source_<field>` methods feed completion candidates for dynamic values, `source_<field>` can have `choice` argument defined to receive partial current value for the field, to alter return options behaviour
- Multiline fields complete the special `load-terminal` token.

```text
devices cli <TAB>
  -> suggests fields such as `commands`, `hosts`, and `plugin`

devices cli plugin net<TAB>
  -> completes `netmiko`

devices cli hosts ceos<TAB>
  -> completes values from `source_hosts()`
```

## Partial Matches And Suggestions

PICLE distinguishes between incomplete commands and incorrect commands.

```text
picle#dev
Incomplete command, possible completions: devices
```

If the token does not belong to the current model, PICLE prints an error. When there are close matches, it appends a `Did you mean` suggestion.

## Built-in `man` Commands

`App` mounts `picle.models.MAN` automatically under `man`.

```text
picle#man tree
picle#man tree devices
picle#man json-schema
picle#man json-schema devices.cli
```

`man tree` prints a command tree and marks required fields, multiline fields, and dynamic dictionary keys.

`man json-schema` prints JSON schema for the root model or for a dotted path.

Notes:

- Dotted paths use field names, aliases, or serialization aliases.
- `man tree` requires Rich to render the tree.
- `man json-schema` is useful when you want to expose the shell structure as machine-readable data.
