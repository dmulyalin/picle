# Introducing PICLE

The command-line interface (CLI) is the software interface used to
interact with the system. From CLI you can run commands and receive
output.

The command-line interface usually includes lots of shortcuts and 
commands for to get help, autocompletion, argument choices and validation 
of input.

PICLE creates structures of shell modes hierarchies, as illustrated in 
Figure 1. The hierarchy of each mode is made up of cascading branches 
of related functions commonly used together.

Figure 1.

The top level of each hierarchy is much like the top of the UNIX filesystem
(\), and shell mode hierarchies are similar to the directory structure on 
UNIX systems, PCs, and Macs.

## Understanding Shell Modes Hierarchy

The structured hierarchy of the command-line shell interfaces is one of the
many advantages of PICLE and by making it capable of logically grouping 
activities, PICLE helps to build a regular, consistent syntax for knowing 
where you are, finding what you want, moving around the interface, and 
entering commands.

When you first log in to the CLI, the command-line interface is at the top
level of the CLI mode.

Figure 2 provides a view of the sample CLIâ€™s tree structure from the top level, 
with an example of its cascading hierarchy through the commands. For 
example, the show weather hierarchy includes today, last_hour, tomorrow, 
and more. The structured grouping of commands makes it easy to move quickly
up and down the hierarchical path or to a specific function anywhere in 
the CLI.
