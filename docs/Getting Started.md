# Introducing PICLE

Command-line interface (CLI) is the software interface used to
interact with the system. From CLI you can run commands and receive
output.

The command-line interface usually includes lots of shortcuts and 
commands to get help, autocompletion, argument choices and validation 
of input.

PICLE creates structures of shell modes hierarchies, as illustrated in 
Figure 1. The hierarchy of each mode is made up of cascading branches 
of related functions used together.

## Understanding Shell Modes Hierarchy

Structured hierarchy of the command-line shell interfaces is one of the
advantages of PICLE. PICLE helps to build regular, consistent syntax enabling
efficient navigation and command execution.

When you first log in to the CLI, the command-line interface is at the top
level of the hierarchy.

Figure 2 provides a view of the sample CLIâ€™s tree structure from the top level, 
with an example of its cascading hierarchy through the commands. For 
example, the show weather hierarchy includes today, last_hour, tomorrow, 
and more. The structured grouping of commands makes it easy to move quickly
up and down the hierarchical path or to a specific function anywhere in 
the CLI.
